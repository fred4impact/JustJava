 ********** What is MAVEN  ****** Gradle Java

 Maven is a powerful build automation and project management tool primarily used for Java projects.

 It simplifies the  process of building, managing dependencies, and deploying applications.

 Maven uses an XML configuration file called  pom.xml (Project Object Model) to manage
 1. project configurations,
 2. dependencies
 3. build lifecycle, and plugins.

 Key Features of Maven:

     1. Dependency Management: Automatically downloads and manages project libraries and dependencies.
     2. Build Lifecycle: Handles different phases of a build, such as compile, test, and package.
     3. Project Structure: Enforces a standard directory layout for project files.
     4. Plugins: Supports various plugins to extend its functionality, such as code compilation, testing, and packaging

2. mvn compile - Compiles the project's source code

3. mvn test - ting framework likRuns tests using a tese JUnit or TestNG.

4. mvn package - Compiles the code and packages it into a distributable format, such as a JAR or WAR file.

5. mvn install - mvn install

6. mvn deploy - Deploys the final package to a remote repository for sharing with other developers or for production use.

7. mvn site - Generates a site or documentation for the project, based on the information provided in the pom.xml.

8. mvn dependency:tree - Prints a tree representation of the project's dependencies, useful for troubleshooting version conflicts.
